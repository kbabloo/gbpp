			  	<p>G. B. Pant Institute of Technology, a premier Institute of Govt. of NCT of Delhi has been playing a vital role in the field of Technical Education. The Institute had a standing of 55 years as it was established in 1961, and was renamed after the renowned freedom fighter Sh. Govind Ballabh Pant. The Institute is spread over a plot area of 20.25 acres. It consists of spacious academic complexes, residential complex, workshops, edusat facilities, ICT equipped lecture theatres and playfield with green and parking area. The Institute has 5 academic departments, Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Production and Automobile. This is an exciting time for GBPIT as we embark on a new phase of growth with the launch of B.VOC Programmes (affiliated to GGSIP University).</p>
				<p>Apart from academic activities, the co-curricular activities, Sports, cultural and social service activities form an integral part of the Institute. The students get full opportunity to participate in co-curricular and extra curricular activities leading to a holistic personality development. We promote faculty Development Programmes, Seminars, workshops, and conferences with an intention to brace themselves with the latest development and challenges in their respective fields.</p>

				<p>We empower our students through holistic, transformative and innovative education that equips them with skills and we motivate our students to advance their own careers. We instill knowledge, skills and the right kind of attitude in the students with the help of dedicated faculty, library and labs.</p>

				<p>The enthusiasm of staff and students and the alumni of the Institute have done exceedingly well in all spheres of life and brought name and fame for themselves as well as to their Alma Mater. The vigor that I have observed among the faculty members of GBPIT is highly commendable. With their unwavering commitment to impart necessary knowledge and skills they are unflinchingly trying to inspire the students to dream big by persuading them to achieve their goals.</p>
